# Hypno Toadface

This is a weekend project, attempting to display some graphics using Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager).

## Why?

Do something cool with a headless server that has HDMI output and barebones CoreOS.

When connected to a 4K TV, show something interesting instead of a login console with a tiny font.

This works well on an off-brand NUC with a Celeron CPU N3350 CPU and 4GB RAM, and maxes out at 30 FPS when rendering 4K images
(most likely it's limited by the HDMI interface).

ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD
